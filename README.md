# Anastomosis
Anastomosis is a peer-reviewed journal, operated by volunteer scientists whom carefully select not yet published research, essays and journalism related to the broad subject of networks. Topics within the subject of network science can be from any discipline from computer science topics such as computer networks, decentralized software, cryptocurrency to biology topics such as mycology and neuroscience.

Anastomosis utlizes an open submission system, anyone from first-time authors to researchers can participate.

Anastomosis falls into a categy of scientific literature often called "gray literature", a term used to describe a wide variety of literture that is not published by traditional commerical, academic publishing. Recognizing the myraid of problems found within the current academic publishing model we belive instead of trying to reform the existing system we can bring more change by introducing standards, building open source tools and creating high quality publications. We believe this new standard can be used to define a new subset of "gray literature" called "open research publishing".

## Open Research Publishing
Open Research Publishing is defined by the open standard being actively being created by participants within the field. The standard seeks to address the common problems with gray literature publications.

**Bibliographic Control** A minimum requirement must be established that allows anonymous publications while providing enough information to provide meaningful bibliographic control.

**Formating and Layouts** An open standard for formatting and layouts must be established that present published work inline with existing trends in professional publications. Open and free layouts which meet this standard must be made available.

**Electronic Publishing** Operating as a decentralized organization will help address the problems with longevity that electronic publishers can be subject to.
