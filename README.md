# Anastomosis
Anastomosis is a peer-reviewed journal, operated by volunteer scientists whom carefully select not yet published research, essays and journalism related to the broad subject of networks.

## Issues
Articles submitted to Anastomosis are collected and published as issues in a EPUB, a free and open publishing standard.

### Alpha Issues
In order to experiment with the publication process, and to better understand the tools that will need to be created Anastomosis first issues will be named after early software releases. These issues will follow the evolving Open Research Publishing standard being developed but will contain on average less ariticles with relaxed length requirements. 

*There are no published issues yet, if you are interested in submitting read the [submission guidelines](https://github.com/Anastomosis/Submissions).*
